h1. Grid2ps

grid2ps is a postscript graphics generator for gridded data written in FORTRAN. It currently accepts binary and ascii CEDRIC file format ('mudras'), but netCDF support is underway. The program can generate line or filled contours, vectors, and some symbol support. The best thing about grid2ps is the fact that the generated postscript is human-readable, unlike most EPS generators out there currently.

h2. Usage

Compile the program using @make@. 
The current version compiles under gcc/gfortran, but the binary CEDRIC support is broken with this compiler and only works under g77. Ascii CEDRIC files are supported under gfortran and g77.
Modify the 'inp1' file to meet your plotting needs, run @grid2ps@, and select the number of panels for your plot. You will need an inp file for each panel (e.g. inp1, inp2, inp3, etc.)
The postscript files can be modified directly with vim or your favorite text editors, or can be opened for further post-processing with Adobe Illustrator.
